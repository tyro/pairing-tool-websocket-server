Thanks for your interest in the project. We welcome thoughts, suggestions and contributions.

Please note that while we welcome pull requests, we may not be able to accept all of them immediately.
We will work with individual contributors to ensure overall project goals and quality standards are met.

Before submitting your first pull request, please take a moment to read and sign (electronically or otherwise)
the [CLA](Contributor_License_Agreement.pdf) file in the project, and either send via mail to the address within,
or email to opensource@tyro.com. Please specify the same email address in the CLA that you will use to submit
your pull request.

A signed CLA only needs to be submitted for your first pull request from a particular email address, not for subsequent ones.
